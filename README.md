# Simple BlockChain

A simple implementation of a BlockChain in Haskell. Not meant to be used in production.

## TODO list
- [x] Block implementation
- [x] Refine Block hashing (using cryptonite?)
- [ ] Node implementation
- [ ] Consensus Algorithm
- [ ] Persistance of Block \[and chain\] (using groundhog?)

### Long shots
- [ ] Basic proof of stake algorithm?
- [ ] Develop node simulator to test blockchain resiliance?
